# cs-eco-dash

A CS:GO economy dashboard.

# Usage

Once this is useful, there will be binary releases.
This is not currently useful, so there are no binary releases.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/mathphreak/cs-eco-dash.git
cargo build --release
```

Then run `target/release/cs-eco-dash`.

Point a Web browser to `localhost:3000` and press the "Install/Update" button if
it's visible.

Launch CS:GO. Keep that Web browser open in a second monitor, or close it and open `localhost:3000` in the Steam overlay.

Start a game and watch things happen!
